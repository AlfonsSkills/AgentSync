# v0.10.0 - Git Cache + Repo Identity Unification

Release Date: 2026-01-16

## Improvements

- Add local git mirror cache to avoid repeated downloads on install
- Reuse cache across SSH/HTTPS/short repository formats via normalized repo key
- Use cached mirror to create temporary working copies, with fallback to direct clone

## Files Changed

- `internal/git/fetcher.go` - Cache repository handling and RepoKey normalization
